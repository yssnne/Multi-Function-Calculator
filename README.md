Math Function Collection with User Interface
This repository contains a C program that provides a user interface for performing various mathematical operations using the functions defined in the Math Function Collection (MFC) library.
Overview
The program allows users to interact with the MFC library through a menu-driven interface. It presents a list of available operations, including:

Arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)
Number theory operations (prime number check, palindrome check)
Solving quadratic equations
Calculating factorial
Checking if a number is even or odd

Users can select the desired operation by entering the corresponding number from the menu.
Features

User-friendly Interface: The program guides the user through the available operations using a menu-driven approach, making it easy to navigate and select the desired functionality.
Modular Design: The mathematical operations are implemented separately in the MFC library, allowing for easy maintenance and extension.
Input Validation: Appropriate input validation is performed to handle invalid user inputs gracefully.

Usage
To use this program, follow these steps:

Compile and run the program.
The menu will be displayed, presenting the available operations.
Enter the number corresponding to the desired operation.
Follow the prompts and provide the required input(s), if any.
The program will perform the selected operation and display the result.
Continue exploring other operations or exit the program as needed.
